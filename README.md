Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio

Web Development has been one of the most challenging courses I have taken. I never did code before and this one is probably the biggest project I have realized. I had a complex process as it has been difficult to understand every function and the proper orther to connect everything.
I think organization is the key for a good product, that is how I tried to with an specific order for my projects as there are many points to cover for different sections that have to be conected at the same time.
I also learnt that specificity is important for every element to be managed in a better way and there are many ways to accomplish different layouts and combinations but is necessary to research and plan in order to get the elements that work better.
